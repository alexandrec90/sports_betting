# Sports Betting

Sports bet automater and data collector

Generated from [devkit](https://github.com/alexandrec90/devkit)'s project
template. The agent harness in `scripts/hooks/` is vendored from there — see
`CLAUDE.md`, "Vendored agent harness".

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in the placeholders
uv sync --all-extras          # creates .venv from the committed uv.lock
# no uv? pip install -e ".[dev]" works, but resolves fresh instead of from the lock
docker compose up -d
pytest
```

In VS Code, `Ctrl+Shift+B` runs the default build task and the task quick-pick
(`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Run Task") lists everything else, each with a one-line `detail`
explaining what it costs and what it touches.

## Host ports

This checkout is **slot 4** in devkit's `ports.toml`. Every published port
is its conventional base plus the slot:

| Service | Host port |
| --- | --- |
| postgres | 5436 |

Regenerate the `.env` block for any checkout with
`python <devkit>/scripts/devkit_ports.py <checkout-name>`.

## Parallel worktrees

A second checkout runs its own stack side by side:

```bash
git worktree add ../sports_betting-b sports_betting-b
cd ../sports_betting-b
cp ../sports_betting/.env .env    # then replace the ports block — slot 5
python <devkit>/scripts/devkit_ports.py sports_betting-b
docker compose up -d
```

`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` must equal the directory name in each. See `CLAUDE.md`,
"Parallel worktrees", for the rules that keep the two stacks independent.

## Layout

```text
sports_betting/                  application code
tests/                tests
scripts/                 project scripts (Python, each with tests)
scripts/hooks/           vendored agent harness — edit upstream in devkit
.devkit.toml      the per-project harness seam (NOT vendored)
docker-compose.yml       the local stack
sports_betting/archive/          data-lake writer + DuckDB read lens
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml` runs lint, tests, and the harness drift check on
every PR. The drift check is only meaningful when it can see devkit — if it prints
"nothing to do (skipping)", the gate is inert and the wiring needs fixing.

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly dependency PRs, and
`.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml` merges them once the gate passes —
patch/minor bumps of anything, plus majors confined to dev tooling. A major that
touches a runtime dependency is labelled `needs-manual-merge` and waits for you.

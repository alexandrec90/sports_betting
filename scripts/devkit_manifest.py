"""The path lists `sync-devkit.py` vendors, retires and gates -- data, and nothing else.

Cut out of `sync-devkit.py`, whose `file_lines` baseline had been raised nine times for
the same reason: a vendored file is a MANIFEST entry, a MANIFEST entry could live nowhere
but the MANIFEST, and the MANIFEST lived in the tool. Here the list grows without growing
the tool, and the tool stays the size of its logic.

Two readers, and both constrain the spelling:

- `sync-devkit.py` imports it by name, and re-exports every name below, so
  `sync_devkit.MANIFEST` and friends are what they always were to every caller and test.
- `structure_check.vendored_paths` reads `MANIFEST` and `GATED_MANIFEST` off this file's
  *source* with `ast.literal_eval`, in every consumer. Keep both pure literals.

Stdlib only by construction -- it imports nothing. A consumer's first pull after this
file existed runs its *old* `sync-devkit.py`, whose inline list does not name it, so the
new tool can arrive alone; `sync-devkit.py` then loads this file from the source it was
given (`--src` / `$DEVKIT_DIR`) and refuses to run without it rather than on a partial
list, which would read every file in the receipt as retired and delete it.

Tested through `scripts/hooks/tests/test_sync_devkit.py`, where the MANIFEST always was.

    # workflow is a case in point -- it is missing `issues: write`, the `--force` on
    # `gh label create`, and `GH_REPO`, three fixes written for failures it can still
    # hit, and nothing anywhere could report that.
    #
    # The gate itself (`.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`) is deliberately NOT here and
    # stays a template: its jobs are the project's -- services, migrations, a frontend
    # tier -- and carameli's five-job gate is the proof that a shared one would either
    # delete real work or live permanently exempted.

    # filter, and the workflow it waits on is titled `PR Gate` in every project
    # including devkit.

    # `.github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml` was here in v0.7.0 and is NOT any
    # more. The argument for vendoring it was that its one variable -- the Python
    # version -- had moved to the caller, so nothing project-specific was left. Two
    # consumers disproved that on the first pull that reached them, and both failures
    # were silent-until-CI:
    #
    #   - apt-finder's copy opened with a step that clones its private sibling
    #     `data-lake` into `../data-lake`, because `[tool.uv.sources]` declares an
    #     editable path dependency there. The vendored copy deleted the step, and every
    #     job then died on `Distribution not found` before running a check.
    #   - carameli does not use `uv sync` at all. It installs pip-tools compiled locks
    #     with `uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`,
    #     pinning uv itself to the version in that lock, and takes an `extra-packages`
    #     input its weekly mutation job passes. `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups`
    #     cannot serve any of that -- there is no `uv.lock` to sync from.
    #
    # What varies is not the Python version. It is **how a project installs**, and that
    # is exactly the kind of thing `templates/` is for. It is rendered from
    # `templates/core/dot-github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml`, which is a

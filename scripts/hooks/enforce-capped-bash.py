"""PreToolUse hook: blocks the few shell commands whose output scales with the tree.

This gate used to work the other way round, and the inversion is the whole content of
this file. It required every Bash call to *prove* it was bounded -- through the wrapper,
a `head`/`tail` cap, a redirect, or membership in a growing list of exempt shapes -- and
blocked everything it could not recognise. Recognising bounded shell is not a small
problem: it is most of a shell parser plus a model of what every command prints, and the
exempt tier grew to twenty-five regexes covering heredocs, brace groups, `case` arms,
loop keywords, env-assignment prefixes, `git` global options, and the difference between
a backtick inside single quotes and one inside double quotes.

It did not converge, and the transcripts say so rather than an opinion. Of the 305 blocks
recoverable from this workspace's sessions, **139 -- 46% -- are allowed by the very next
version of the gate**: they were not commands anyone needed to rewrite, they were this
file's own bugs. Fourteen of its eighteen commits are titled some variant of "stop the
gate blocking X". Each of those cost a turn plus the ~1 KB of remedy prose the block
message had to carry, and the remedy was often one the shape could not take -- a heredoc,
a loop and a brace group all fail to survive the wrapper's `cmd.exe`.

A fix here also reaches a consuming project only when someone runs `sync-devkit.py
--pull`, so a false positive keeps being *re*-reported for as long as the vendored copies
lag. The report that prompted this rewrite was a `sed -n '1,30p'` block that had already
been fixed upstream the day before.

So the policy is now stated in the direction that is decidable. **Everything is allowed
except a short list of commands whose output grows with the repository** -- `ls`, `cat`,
`find`, `tree`, `du`, `env`, `git status`, an uncounted `git log`, and a raw
`git diff`/`git show`. Those nine were 68 of the 166 blocks that were the old gate working
as designed, which is to say that nearly everything it was ever right about, it was right
about for one of nine reasons. The list is closed by policy: a command earns a place on it
by being observed to flood a session, not by being suspected of it.

What this gives up is real and worth naming: an unknown command that prints a megabyte is
now allowed through. Two things carry that case instead of a block.

  * `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` in `.claude/settings.json` is a native, unconditional bound
    on every Bash result. It needs no grammar and cannot false-positive, because it
    truncates bytes that already exist rather than predicting bytes that might.
  * `invoke-capped.py` is still here and still the right tool for a test or lint run,
    where a head *and* a tail window beats truncation from one end. It is now a thing to
    reach for rather than a thing to be blocked into.

Failing **open** is therefore the design and not a gap in it. A blocklist that cannot
parse a statement allows it, and the backstop above bounds the cost; the allow-list this
replaced failed *closed* on everything it could not parse, which is precisely how a gate
arrives at a 46% false-positive rate.

Two pieces of the old parser are kept, because both prevent a block rather than cause one.
`split_top_level` still drops heredoc bodies and comments -- otherwise a commit message
mentioning `cat` is read as a command -- and it still holds a `{ ...; }` group together,
so the cap in `{ pwd; cat big; } | head -c N` is seen to bind the `cat` inside it.

Decision logic is exposed as pure functions (`decide`, `offenders`, `noisy_reason`,
`has_cap`, `statements`, `get_value`) so it can be unit-tested without spawning a
subprocess. See `scripts/hooks/tests/test_enforce_capped_bash.py`.

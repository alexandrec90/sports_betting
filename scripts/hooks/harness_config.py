"""Per-project configuration for the shared agent-harness hook scripts.

The hook scripts (`stop.py`, and later the rest of `scripts/hooks/`) are meant to
be **vendored unchanged into every project**. Everything that differs between
projects -- the control-env prefix, the DB credentials/ports/service names, the
frontend layout, and the source-tree shape --
lives here, read from a committed `.devkit.toml` at the repo root. The
scripts stay shape-agnostic; a new project drops in a manifest instead of forking
the code.

Design contract:
  - **stdlib only** (`tomllib`, 3.11+). Hooks run before the venv is active.
  - **Never raises.** A missing/unparseable manifest, or an interpreter without
    `tomllib`, falls back to `Config()` defaults -- a minimal but valid harness
    (lint + script-tests, no DB tier, no frontend). A config typo must never
    break the Stop hook.
  - **Neutral defaults.** Defaults describe a generic Python project, not
    carameli; carameli's specifics come from its own `.devkit.toml`.

Pure and unit-tested in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_harness_config.py`.

    pip-tools locks, else `pyproject.toml`), because a lockfile cannot drift from

    that fits none of those shapes; it then wins over detection.

    `version` is an override for the same reason. A lockfile pins packages, not the

    from whatever interpreter happened to be running it -- the workstation default, not
    the version the project is pinned to in its `FROM python:` tag, its compiled locks,
    its type-checker config and CI. The box came out announcing itself provisioned with a
    venv the container does not match, and the mismatch surfaced later as an install or a
    type-check failure that reads as a broken branch rather than as the wrong interpreter.
    Provisioning now reads an exact pin out of `.python-version` or a `FROM python:` tag
    when this field is empty, so set it only where those disagree with what the box should
    run, or where the pin lives somewhere else entirely (`"3.12"`, or a full `"3.12.7"`).

    does. carameli's `CORS_ORIGINS` is the case that found this: the box publishes
    its frontend on its own port, the seeded `.env` still names the primary's, and
    the app then refuses every request its own frontend makes -- as a CORS error in
    the console, which reads as an application bug rather than as a box that was
    provisioned half-configured.

    Ports are the only thing devkit knows generically, so this is a template map
    rather than a fixed key: `${NAME}` expands against the managed env devkit
    already writes -- `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and one `<SERVICE>_HOST_PORT` per
    service in the port registry. A template naming something else is left out
    rather than written half-expanded, because a `.env` line containing a literal
    `${...}` is a value compose would pass through to the app verbatim.

    `ui_services` is what makes a UI-only preview possible: the compose services
    that make up this project's UI tier (usually just `["frontend"]`). Empty --
    the default -- means the project has not declared one and `worktree.py
    preview --ui` refuses, because devkit cannot guess which of a stack's
    services is the frontend. `ui_env` is `env`'s sibling for that mode only:
    the same template map, applied on top of `env`, for values that are only
    right when the backend is the *static checkout's* stack rather than the
    box's own (a dev-proxy target, an API base URL). In a UI-only box the
    managed env the templates expand against mixes two slots -- the box's own
    ports for `ui_services`, the source checkout's for everything else -- so a
    template like `http://localhost:${APP_HOST_PORT}` lands on the backend that

"""Append-only ledger of harness events, so a block is diagnosable without the chat.

Until now, most of what the harness *does to an agent* left its only record in that
agent's conversation: the capped-Bash gate blocked a command, the worktree guard routed
an edit into a box, a box spawn failed -- and the sole account of it was prose in a
session someone else has to be told to go read. The one exception proved the pattern:
`worktree.py`'s reap ledger exists because a box vanished and nothing on the machine
could say which pass took it. This module generalises that ledger to the rest of the
harness, so a devkit-scoped session diagnoses from a file instead of from hearsay.

Format follows the reap ledger, and for its reasons: one line per event, an ISO stamp
followed by tab-separated `key=value` pairs. The file is read by grepping for a project
or a session id months later, which rules out JSON (an interrupted write leaves an
unparseable document) and prose. Append-only, never rotated -- a record that the next
run overwrites is not a record.

Where the ledger lives decides who can write to it, and there are two callers:

- **Workspace scripts** (`worktree-guard.py`) know their devkit checkout by `__file__`
  and pass `root` explicitly.
- **Vendored copies** in consuming projects know nothing about this machine's layout.
  They reach the ledger through `$DEVKIT_DIR` -- the same machine-level seam
  `sync-devkit.py` reads -- with one fallback: unset, a copy that *is* devkit writes
  to its own checkout, because there the ledger and the copy are the same repo. Unset
  anywhere else (CI, a fresh clone, anyone else's machine) `record` is a silent no-op.
  A diagnostic ledger must never be a reason a hook fails, so unlike the drift gate
  there is no "stamped but unset" failure mode here: silence is always the right
  degradation.

Event names and their fields belong to the writers; this module only owns the format.
`record` never raises -- it is called from hooks on paths where they are already
reporting something else, and from blocking flows that must still block.

Tested in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_harness_events.py`.

"""PostToolUse hook: auto-fix just-edited Python files and relay what remains.

Runs after Edit/Write/MultiEdit/apply_patch on `.py` files. It applies the cheap,
deterministic fixers in place (`ruff format`, then `ruff check --fix`), so
formatting drift never survives to a commit — the CI lint job no longer gates on
it. Any lint finding ruff *cannot* auto-fix (undefined name, real bug pattern) is
printed to stderr with exit code 2, which Claude Code feeds straight back into the
coding agent's turn so it fixes the issue before finishing — no CI round-trip.

Deliberately ruff-only and edit-scoped to stay fast: the slower,
cross-file checks (mypy / vulture / frontend) belong in the Stop backstop and CI,
not on every keystroke. Best-effort throughout: a missing ruff or an unreadable
payload exits 0 so a tooling gap never blocks the agent.

**A file is linted against the project it lives in, or not at all.** The hook's own
location is the wrong root for both of the cases that actually occur. An agent edits
inside an ephemeral box under `<workspace>/.worktrees/`, which is not under the static
checkout this hook is vendored into, and it also writes scratch files to a session temp
directory, which is not under any project at all. Both used to be linted anyway, with
an absolute path and the *hook's* repo as the working directory, so ruff resolved
`per-file-ignores` against a config that does not own the file — the ignores silently
did not apply and rules the project deliberately disables (`S603`, `S607`, `T201`,
`S101` in tests) fired as blocking false positives on a throwaway script.

So `project_root_for` walks up from the file for a project marker: the file is linted
with that directory as the working directory, and skipped entirely when there is no
marker above it. A scratchpad stops being linted; a box starts being linted correctly,
by its own config rather than the vendoring checkout's.

**A marker is a ruff config, not a repository.** `.git` was one of them, which made the
claim "this tree configured ruff" out of a fact that says nothing about ruff at all, and
so caught every checkout an agent can reach — including a reference checkout that ships
no harness and no Python config. There, this hook was the whole harness applying itself
to a repo deliberately exempted from the rest of it: an edit to a `.py` file was
reformatted in place under ruff's *defaults*, and any finding those defaults could not
auto-fix exited 2 and blocked the turn. Nobody chose those rules for that tree, which is
the exact failure the paragraph above is about, one directory further out. Requiring a
config file states the claim honestly and needs no list of which checkouts are exempt —
a tree that configures ruff opts in by carrying the config, and every other tree is left
alone. Boxes are unaffected: a worktree checks out tracked files, and the config is one.

Pure helpers (`parse_hook_input`, `extract_paths`, `is_lintable`, `find_ruff`,
`project_root_for`) are unit-tested in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_lint_fix.py`.

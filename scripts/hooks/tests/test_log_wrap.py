"""Tests for scripts/log-wrap.py (the task failure-artifact wrapper).

Vendored, so nothing here may name a value that varies per project: every path is
built under `tmp_path`, and the wrapper itself resolves `logs/` from the cwd rather
than from `__file__` for the same reason.

The interesting half is what the artifact does when a run *passes*. A wrapper that
only writes on failure leaves the previous failure sitting there, and the next agent
reads it as current -- which is the specific failure `.claude/rules/engineering.md`
requires an empty-on-success artifact to prevent.

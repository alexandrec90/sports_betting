"""Tests for the Dependabot auto-merge retry.

**Vendored, so nothing here may name a project.** Every input arrives in the environment
or from an API call, which is what lets these tests build the whole world as a dict and a
fake `subprocess.run`: no repository, no network, no `gh`.

What they pin is the pair of properties that make a scheduled merge safe rather than
reckless. It merges only what the event-driven job would already have merged -- the
`automerge` label something with write access applied, a successful `PR Gate` on the
*current* head SHA -- and it re-derives every one of those rather than inheriting any of
them, because a schedule carries no PR and no gate result to trust.

The regression underneath all of it: on 2026-08-17 two already-green PRs were stranded
when `gh pr merge` hit a GraphQL 503, and nothing ever retried them.

# `HTTP 403: Resource not accessible by integration`, and the retry for stranded
# auto-merges had not run since in any repo holding an `automerge` PR.

# was opened the first night it fired, 2026-09-07, and updated hourly for the nine days
# until the PR it was stranding merged -- which is worth stating because it locates the
# gap precisely. Nothing here failed to *notice*. What was missing was the thing that
# would have made the bug impossible to ship: the permission a call needs is not in the
# file you add the call to, and no test spanned the two.

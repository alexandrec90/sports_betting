"""Integration tests for the SessionStart provisioning hook.

`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` had **no tests**, and that is precisely how it
shipped a bug that broke every project except the one it was written for: it read
`requirements-dev.txt` unconditionally and expanded `${uv_version:?...}`. `:?` on
an empty value *exits* a non-interactive shell, and the trailing `|| echo` cannot
catch a parameter-expansion failure — so in any project without pip-tools locks,
provisioning died mid-script, before the PATH export, leaving an empty venv and no
ruff/mypy/pytest. Only remote sandboxes run that code path, so nothing local ever
went red.

**This file is vendored into every consuming project**, so it may not assert any
one project's dependency model. It builds throwaway projects of each shape and
checks the script dispatches correctly in all of them.

The script is driven for real (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`) with stub executables on
PATH, so nothing is installed and no network is touched. Every stub appends its
argv to a log, which is what the assertions read.

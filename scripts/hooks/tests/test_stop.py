"""Unit tests for the portable Stop hook.

**This file is vendored into every consuming project.** Every value that varies per
project — the control-env prefix, `app/`, the DB credentials, whether a frontend
exists — must come from `hook.CFG` (which the hook itself reads from that project's
`.devkit.toml`), never from a literal. Hard-coding carameli's values here
made the vendored suite fail in any repo shaped differently, which is what the
config seam exists to prevent.

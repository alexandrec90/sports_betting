"""Run every linter and write the failures to a single parseable artifact.

The contract this implements (see CLAUDE.md, "Failure artifacts"): an agent fixing
lint reads `logs/lint-errors.log`, never the terminal. So this script keeps the
terminal to a status line plus the artifact path, and puts everything actionable in
the file — on failure *and* on success, where it writes an empty artifact so a stale
run can't mislead the next agent.

Auto-fix runs before the reporting pass, so only genuinely unfixable errors are
reported and the agent never burns a cycle on something `ruff --fix` already solved.

Usage:
    python scripts/lint-all.py            # whole repo
    python scripts/lint-all.py --changed  # working-tree diff vs HEAD, plus untracked

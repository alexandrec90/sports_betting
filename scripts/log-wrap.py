"""Task failure-artifact wrapper.

Runs a command, streams its output to the terminal as it arrives, and persists that
output to a parseable file under `logs/` when the command fails. Exits with the
wrapped command's code, so VS Code still shows the right task icon.

Usage (tasks.json):
  python scripts/log-wrap.py [--always] "Task Name" -- <command> [args...]

Example:
  python scripts/notify-wrap.py "Ship: Sweep Workspace" --
    python scripts/log-wrap.py "Ship: Sweep Workspace" --
      python scripts/sweep.py

**Why a second wrapper rather than a flag on `notify-wrap.py`.** They compose in that
order and each does one thing: the toast needs only an exit code, this needs the
output. Keeping them apart is also what lets a task opt out of either -- a script that
already writes its own artifact (`run-tests.py`, `lint-all.py`) does not need this one,
and wrapping it anyway would produce a second, redundant file.

**The artifact is the point, per `.claude/rules/engineering.md`:** a task's failure has
to survive the terminal it scrolled past. `logs/<slug>.log` is overwritten per run and
**emptied on success**, so a stale report can never outlive the failure it describes.

**`--always` keeps the passing run too, and is for the unattended caller.** For a task
someone clicked, an empty file is unambiguous -- they watched it pass. Nobody watches a
scheduled job, and there "empty" covers three different states: it passed, it ran and
declined to do anything, or it has not run since the last time it passed. A prune that
skips every night because containers are up is *working as designed* and looks
identical to one that stopped being scheduled at all, which is the failure
`scripts/schedule_health.py` was written after. So a job on a schedule records its
passes as well; the file is still overwritten per run and still capped, so the cost is
one bounded file rather than a growing one.

Colour survives the wrapping. A captured child is talking to a pipe rather than a
terminal, and most tools drop their colour the moment they notice -- so `FORCE_COLOR`
and `PY_COLORS` are set (when the caller has not) to keep the live view readable, and
the escape sequences are stripped back out of the file, which wants to be greppable.

Pure and stdlib-only; every decision is an importable function tested in
`scripts/hooks/tests/test_log_wrap.py`.

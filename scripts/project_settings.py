"""The project's own harness config: `.claude/settings.json`, which devkit never vendors.

Split out of `sync-devkit.py` along the seam its own comments already described. That
module copies files listed in a MANIFEST; this one *edits* a file the project owns, and
the difference is a contract, not a detail -- which is why the settings code there kept
needing a paragraph to explain why it was allowed to write at all. `sync-devkit.py` was
also past every structural limit it holds other files to, and this is the half that had
somewhere else to be.

The pull makes one pass over that file. It **unwires every agent hook**: no hook is
wired anywhere -- not devkit's, not the template's, not one a project added -- so a
consumer's settings lose their whole `hooks` block on the pull that delivers this. The
hook scripts are still vendored, and inert while nothing names them. And it **adds the
agent-shell environment** (`AGENT_ENV`) wherever a key is missing, never overwriting a
value the project set itself.

Stdlib only, like everything else here that runs before a virtualenv exists.

Tested in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_project_settings.py`.

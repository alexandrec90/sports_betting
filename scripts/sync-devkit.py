"""Vendor the shared agent-harness scripts into this project, and drift-check them.

The hook/harness scripts are meant to be identical across projects (see
`.devkit.toml` for the per-project seam). Rather than fork them per repo,
one **shared harness repo is the source of truth** and each project commits a
**vendored copy** -- so cloning a single project still gets everything, with no
submodule. This script keeps that copy honest:

  - `--check` (default): fail (exit 1) if any vendored file drifts from the shared
    repo. Wired into the PR gate. **No-ops clean (exit 0) when the shared repo is
    not configured and this project has never pulled**, so CI is safe before a
    project adopts the shared repo; once `DEVKIT_VERSION` exists, an unresolvable
    source is itself a failure rather than a skip (see `main`).
  - `--pull`: copy the shared repo's version into this project (adopt upstream).
    Also remove exact paths retired by the shared repo; project-owned skill state
    is never included in that retirement list.
  - `--push`: copy this project's version into the shared repo (author a change /
    seed a fresh shared repo from the project that currently owns the code).
  - `--list`: print the manifest and resolved source, then exit.

The shared-repo path resolves from `--src` or `$DEVKIT_DIR`. `.devkit.toml`
itself is **never** synced -- it is the per-project config the shared code reads.

`MANIFEST` is the reviewed, portable subset (config loader + the scripts audited so
far); extend it as more scripts are decoupled. Pure helpers (`resolve_src`,
`classify`) are unit-tested in `scripts/hooks/tests/test_sync_devkit.py`.

`BLOCK_MANIFEST` is the second tier: a *region* of a per-project file, delimited by
`<!-- devkit:begin <id> -->` / `<!-- devkit:end <id> -->`, gated byte-for-byte while
the rest of the file stays the project's own. It exists for `CLAUDE.md`, which can
never join `MANIFEST` -- see the tier's own comment block below for why the policy has
to be inline rather than behind a pointer. Every mode handles both tiers; a block that
cannot be located is reported, never skipped.

    # is a one-shot copy: `--pull` never looked at them again, so every fix made here

    # workflow is a case in point -- it is missing `issues: write`, the `--force` on
    # `gh label create`, and `GH_REPO`, three fixes written for failures it can still
    # hit, and nothing anywhere could report that.
    #
    # The gate itself (`.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`) is deliberately NOT here and
    # stays a template: its jobs are the project's -- services, migrations, a frontend
    # tier -- and carameli's five-job gate is the proof that a shared one would either
    # delete real work or live permanently exempted.
    #
    # The auto-merge workflow qualifies because nothing in it varies: no `branches:`
    # filter, and the workflow it waits on is titled `PR Gate` in every project
    # including devkit.
    #
    # `.github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml` was here in v0.7.0 and is NOT any
    # more. The argument for vendoring it was that its one variable -- the Python
    # version -- had moved to the caller, so nothing project-specific was left. Two
    # consumers disproved that on the first pull that reached them, and both failures
    # were silent-until-CI:
    #
    #   - apt-finder's copy opened with a step that clones its private sibling
    #     `data-lake` into `../data-lake`, because `[tool.uv.sources]` declares an
    #     editable path dependency there. The vendored copy deleted the step, and every
    #     job then died on `Distribution not found` before running a check.
    #   - carameli does not use `uv sync` at all. It installs pip-tools compiled locks
    #     with `uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`,
    #     pinning uv itself to the version in that lock, and takes an `extra-packages`
    #     input its weekly mutation job passes. `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups`
    #     cannot serve any of that -- there is no `uv.lock` to sync from.
    #
    # What varies is not the Python version. It is **how a project installs**, and that
    # is exactly the kind of thing `templates/` is for. It is rendered from
    # `templates/core/dot-github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml`, which is a

    # so there is no project value left in either the workflow or its script.

    # It is vendored rather than added as a job to the nightly *because* the nightly is

      pull wrote, so someone owns it now.
    - **Un-vendored** -- it left the MANIFEST because it became a `templates/` file.
      **Preserved**, and this is the fix. Deleting it was silent data loss: `templates/`
      is a one-shot copy consulted only by `new-project.py`, so nothing put the file
      back and nothing on either side reported the gap. When
      `.github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml` was un-vendored, the pull deleted it
      from every consumer that had *not* customised it -- and customising it was the
      only thing that saved the two that survived, by accident of the sha check above.
      Two projects' PR gates then died on an unresolvable local action, and a third's
      nightly failed silently for a week because only its nightly used the action.
    - **Retired.** Genuinely obsolete, nothing should have it. Deleted, as before.

    The distinction needs the source, so `src=None` (a caller that cannot supply one)
    falls back to the old behaviour rather than preserving everything -- a receipt entry
    that is neither in the MANIFEST nor in `templates/` really is retired, and never
